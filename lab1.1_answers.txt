Questions and Answers ---

1. When you run flex flex-wc.l, what output file does flex write?

A: In my directory it creates the file 'lex.yy.c'

2. When you run gcc on Flex's output .c file, what is the executable file named?

A: a.out

3. Run your program on itself with ./a.out <flex-wc.l

A: When running it on itself with './a.out <flex-wc.l' (on a modified flex-wc.l) i got the following...

brmannal@BensLaptop:/mnt/c/Users/benma/OneDrive/Desktop/Senior Year/Spring/CSE423/k0$ ./a.out <flex-wc.l

4. Fix your program to take the name of the file as a command line argument, instead of using < to redirect standard input.

A: my output after adjusting main to accept a command line arguement (passing lex.yy.c as the arguement) is as follows...

brmannal@BensLaptop:/mnt/c/Users/benma/OneDrive/Desktop/Senior Year/Spring/CSE423/k0$ ./a.out lex.yy.c
rows=1752 words=7075 chards=44232

5. Convert to separate compilation! move main() into a separate main.c and write a makefile that compiles main.c and lex.yy.c separately and then links them.

A: After making a Makefile and compiling the files, linking them, etc, I got the output ...

brmannal@BensLaptop:/mnt/c/Users/benma/OneDrive/Desktop/Senior Year/Spring/CSE423/k0$ ./a.out flex-wc.l
